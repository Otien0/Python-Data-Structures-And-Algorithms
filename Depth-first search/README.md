#Depth-first search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures.
#The algorithm starts at the root node (selecting some arbitrary node as the root node in the case of a graph)
  and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
  
#The DFS algorithm is a recursive algorithm that uses the idea of backtracking.
#It involves exhaustive searches of all the nodes by going ahead, if possible, else by backtracking.
